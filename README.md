# Astroparticle Physics (PHYS-F-467)

### Introduction

These are the notes of the course PHYS-F-467 on astroparticle physics at the Universit\'e Libre de Bruxelles.
The course is intended to be a survey of the emerging field of high-energy particle astrophysics with special emphasis in problem solving. What you can find here is the written notes in ```ipython``` format. The course also relies heavily in visual support. These slides can be found on my [homepage](http://iihe.ac.be/~aguilar)

### Disclaimer and Acknowledgments

The notes are far from original work. I limited myself to scrap the internet and the read the literature on the subject, assimilate the concepts and reproduce them in more or less coherent story. The seed of such work came from Kael Hanson, from whom I inherited the course. After him there is an endless list of people from whom I shamelessly took material: Alexander Kappes, Teresa Montaruli, Stefano Gabici, and a long etc.

### Why there are python tutorials?

Although certainly is not a requirement to understand the physical processed involved in astroparticle phenomena, I think it is beneficial to resolve numerically some of the proposed problems in order to better assimilate the concepts discussed during this course. The ```python``` programming language is used as a tool for constructing these numerical solutions. There exist complete mathematical libraries (```numpy/scipy```) for ```python``` as well as powerful interactive tools and graphical visualization frameworks which make it possible to easily construct problem solvers in a matter of minutes along with graphical output. The idea is also to familiarize the student with what has become one of the most popular analysis tools in the high energy physics as well as astronomy communities.
