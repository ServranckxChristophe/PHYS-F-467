# PHYS-F-467

### Introduction

These are the notes of the course PHYS-F-467 on particle astrophysics.
The course is intended to be a survey of the emerging field of high-energy particle astrophysics with special emphasis in problem solving. What you can find here is the written notes in ```ipython``` format. The course also relies heavily in visual support. These slides can be found in my [homepage](http://iihe.ac.be/~aguilar)

### Disclaimer and Acknowledgments

The notes are by far original work. I limited myself to scrap the internet and the read the literature on the subject to  assimilate the concepts and gather them in more or less coherent story. The seed of such work came from Kael Hanson, from whom I inherited the course. After that there was an endless list of people from whom I shamelessly took material: Alexander Kappes, Teresa Montaruli, Stefano Gabici, etc.

### Why python?

Although certainly is not a requirement to understand the physical processed involved in astroparticle phenomena, it is beneficial to resolve numerically some of the proposed problems in order to better assimilate the concepts discussed during this course. The ```python``` programming language is used as a tool for constructing these numerical solutions. There exist complete mathematical libraries (```numpy/scipy```) for Python as well as powerful interactive tools and graphical visualization frameworks which make it possible to easily construct problem solvers in a matter of minutes along with graphical output. as the programing language. The idea is also to familiarize the student with what has become one of the most popular analysis tools in the high energy physics as well as astronomy communities.
